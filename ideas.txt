prototype of a "github for recipes".  J's idea.  Have a look.

* follow/fork recipes (submit "pull requests" if you think your fork is better than the original)
* cook recipes
* eat recipes
* follow friends/family
* follow chefs
* follow restaurants
* follow celebrities
* submit recipes to restaurants (a UGC menu!)
* compile and print a book (e.g. schools do cookbooks of parent supplied recipes as a fund raiser, but they are always a pain to compile, layout and print)
